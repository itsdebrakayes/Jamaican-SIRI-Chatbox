üáØüá≤ Jamaican AI ‚Äì Responsive Chat UI

Jamaican AI is a modern, mobile-friendly chat interface designed to power a conversational AI that speaks in Jamaican Patois. The goal is to help people in Jamaica and across the diaspora connect with artificial intelligence in a more relatable and culturally relevant way.

This project focuses on building a clean and intuitive chat user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS, serving as the frontend for Jamaican AI. It emulates a real-time messaging app where users can talk to the AI and get responses styled in vibrant, Caribbean-inspired visuals.
